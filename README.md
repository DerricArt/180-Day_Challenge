# 180-Day_Challenge
This is a challenge where I learn everyday about programming starting from web-dev.


I will start learning programming tomorrow(5-5-25) along with my english language learning.
  * This challenge will end in Oct 30, 2025.
  * This challenge is approximately 5 hours per day, programming and english.
  * I will keep my works here and short video documentations for later.
The basic overview of the roadmap I will go through:
HTML -> CSS -> JS -> React -> NextJS or back-end. (I don't know how many days or weeks or months it'll take me to reach this level but if I still have enough time I'll delve into much more deeper topic to further up my learning.)
After that I will start looking for jobs online where I can showcase and test my skills in industry standard level.


May 16, 2025 - I skip my landing page and create a react app which I will publish later on.
